Implementation of K-means method of unsupervised learning of clustering demonstrated in ORIE Lecture 26 on 12/3.

  1. Randomly assign K cluster centers

  2. Assign each Point to closest center

  3. Calculate new cluster center by taking centroid of all points within the clusters

  4. Repeat #2 and #3, Stop when nothing changes


Pros : Simple and quick

Cons : Heuristic, requires pre-known # of clusters, sensitive to outliers, sensitive to where the first centers are placed
